PM Baseline Cost is the initial dataset provided based on which some EDA and baseline random forest models were implemented. 
OPS-PM Baseline Cost (Synthetic) is the final dataset based on which all the other models and visualizations are created. 
The Dashboard_v1.0 is a Power BI file that contains the visualizations of cost variances based on the final dataset based on which analysis was carried out(OPS-PM Baseline Cost (Synthetic)). 
Project_Capstone_week6-7 Python Jupyter notebook contains all the models that were implemented along with the results. 
EDAv1.0 Python Jupyter notebook contains the Exploratory Data Analysis based on the PM Baseline Cost dataset 
EDAv2.0 Python Jupyter notebook contains the Exploratory Data Analysis based on the OPS-PM Baseline Cost (Synthetic) dataset.
