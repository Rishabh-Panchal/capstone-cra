# Forecasting Project Cost Variance and Identifying Project Success Factors

**Dataset Information:** <br>
PM Baseline Cost is the initial dataset provided based on which some EDA and baseline random forest models were implemented. <br>
OPS-PM Baseline Cost (Synthetic) is the final dataset based on which all the other models and visualizations are created. <br>

**Files Information:** <br>
The Dashboard_v1.0 is a Power BI file that contains the visualizations of cost variances based on the final dataset based on which analysis was carried out(OPS-PM Baseline Cost (Synthetic)). <br>
Project_Capstone_week6-7 Python Jupyter notebook contains all the models that were implemented along with the results. <br>
EDAv1.0 Python Jupyter notebook contains the Exploratory Data Analysis based on the PM Baseline Cost dataset <br>
EDAv2.0 Python Jupyter notebook contains the Exploratory Data Analysis based on the OPS-PM Baseline Cost (Synthetic) dataset. <br>
