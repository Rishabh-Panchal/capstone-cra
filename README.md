# Forecasting Project Cost Variance and Identifying Project Success Factors

**Dataset Information:** <br>
PM Baseline Cost is the initial dataset provided based on which some EDA and baseline random forest models were implemented. <br>
OPS-PM Baseline Cost (Synthetic) is the final dataset based on which all the other models and visualizations are created. <br>

**Files Information:** <br>
The Dashboard_v1.0 is a Power BI file that contains the visualizations of cost variances based on the final dataset based on which analysis was carried out(OPS-PM Baseline Cost (Synthetic)). <br>
Project_Capstone_week6-7 Python Jupyter notebook contains all the models that were implemented along with the results. <br>
EDAv1.0 Python Jupyter notebook contains the Exploratory Data Analysis based on the PM Baseline Cost dataset <br>
EDAv2.0 Python Jupyter notebook contains the Exploratory Data Analysis based on the OPS-PM Baseline Cost (Synthetic) dataset. <br>


## Overview
This project aims to revolutionize project management by
creating a sophisticated model that predicts cost variances
and success rates. Using advanced machine learning
techniques and historical data, the team identifies factors
crucial for predicting cost fluctuations and determining
project success. By focusing on predicting cost variance
and identifying success factors, this initiative enhances the
accuracy of cost estimates and improves predictive
analytics capabilities for project outcomes.
